Yes, it will solve some problems—hopefully more easy collaboration across different instances. With GitHub, that’s not a problem, provided that everyone uses GitHub. And No, I don’t think it will move more people towards Gitea, since syndication and self-hosting are usually two “complicated” solutions. Note that I didn’t say complex. Most people will still find it too troublesome to move. Just look at Mastodon VS Twitter. The <code>@user@mastodoninstance</code> thing already trips most people up.</p>",
