I LOVE DnD and other GDR on paper but I never stop to thing about reusing the "tecnique" I gain playing in the real life...
Yes sometime I improvised something and play along with friends (and sometime with colleagues)  but I never thought about the other "ability" I develop playing...

Maybe I will write a post about using DnD ability in the real world
