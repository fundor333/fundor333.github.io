It doesn’t do everything though, and uBlock Origin is still very much needed. Blocked domains by the Pi-Hole will also show up in the uBlock logs (e.g. googletagmanager), even though the request won’t return anything. In general, uBlock is more aggressive and better suited to combat ads. If a site stops working for you, you can disable it with one button press. Chuck in I Don’t Care About Cookies for good measure and you’re all set!
