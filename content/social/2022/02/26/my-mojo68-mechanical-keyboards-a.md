I am a Mechanical Keyboard guy. I love them and I need to feel the Tactile Feedback form my keyboard.
I, also, find better the International Layout for the key but only because I am a programmer. If I need to write for long time in Italian I will change the layout for some shortcut like é á ú í ó.

In this article you can find a good review for the keyboard
