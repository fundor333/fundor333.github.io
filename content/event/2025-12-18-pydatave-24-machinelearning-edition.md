Dear all, we’re back with the [PyData meetups](https://numfocus.org/programs/pydata), focused as always on sharing best practice, methodologies, analysis, machine learning systems, .., with the open-source projects of the [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/sponsored-projects) program — but not only!

We’ll meet **#InPresence** on **Thursday, December 18 at 7:00 PM**.
We’ll be hosted by [Anda Venice Hostel](https://www.andavenice.com/) in the Medusa Room and, for those who cannot join us, it will also be on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK_1RjKro_g) in **#streaming**.

👥 We’ll have two interesting sessions in English 🇬🇧:
🗣 [Árpád Goretity](https://www.linkedin.com/in/h2co3/) and [Oliver Kocsis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/okocsis/) will talk to us about **#NLP** solutions and their optimizations in a local environment: **#OnPremise** is the New Promise – Small, Smart, **#LocalAI** in the age of LLMs
🗣 [Sara Ferro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sara-ferro-ba1aa8139/) will present a blend of theory on classical networks and more recent ones together with more recent ones: **#ImageSegmentation** through **#DeepLearning** Models

And afterwards\, for those who want\, we’ll stay there for \( 🍸 \| 🍺 \) & \( 🍕 \| 🍔 \) and **#networking** until late ‼️

📽 And if you’d like to share ideas, projects, topics, or propose yourself as the next speaker, here’s the usual [Google form](https://forms.gle/rVMWxFnodHaNb9ab9) or [Sessionize](https://sessionize.com/pydata-venice/) !
