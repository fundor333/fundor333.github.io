    Dear all, we’re back with the [PyData meetups](https://www.meetup.com/pydata-venice/), focused as always on sharing best practice, methodologies, analysis, machine learning systems, .., with the [open-source projects](https://numfocus.org/sponsored-projects) of the [NumFOCUS program](https://numfocus.org/programs/pydata) — but not only!

We’ll meet **#InPresence** on **Thursday, December 18 at 7:00 PM**.
We’ll be hosted by [Anda Venice Hostel](https://www.andavenice.com/) in the Medusa Room and, for those who cannot join us, it will also be on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@PyDataVenice/streams) in **#streaming**.

👥 We’ll have two interesting sessions, in Italian 🇮🇹 or in English 🇬🇧 or one and one:
🗣 Here there will be the description of the speakers

And afterwards\, for those who want\, we’ll stay there for \( 🍸 \| 🍺 \) & \( 🍕 \| 🍔 \) and \#networking until late ‼️

📽 And if you’d like to share ideas, projects, topics, or propose yourself as the next speaker, here’s the usual [Google form](https://forms.gle/rVMWxFnodHaNb9ab9) or [Sessionize](https://sessionize.com/pydata-venice-2025-12-18) !
