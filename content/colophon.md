The code for this website is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/fundor333/fundor333.github.io) and created using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Automated deployments are done with Github Action and hosted by GitHub Pages.
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is used as the static site generator and the theme is an edited version (by me) of [Hugo Blog Awesome](https://github.com/hugo-sid/hugo-blog-awesome). Some of the icons are from [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

Some part (some of the static pages) of this site are generated from api, some mine, some from external service and some from json files generated by some of mine [Github automation](https://fundor333.com/post/2025/github-action-for-syndication-links/).

The comments are done with [webmentions](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) and hosted with the [Github automation](https://fundor333.com/post/2025/github-action-for-syndication-links/) in the [repo](https://github.com/fundor333/fundor333.github.io) with all other file needed to build the site.
