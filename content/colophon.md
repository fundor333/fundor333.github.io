## What is this page?

This is a Colophon page or a "How this blog work?" page.

> In publishing, a colophon (/ˈkɒləfən, -fɒn/) is a brief statement containing information about the publication of a book such as an "imprint" (the place of publication, the publisher, and the date of publication).
>
> [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colophon_(publishing))

This page exist because I am a coder with the passion of try new stuff with code or system, so here I collect what I use.

## Some story about this site

This blog start in the August 2012 as a Wordpress site (no I did not leave any trace about it),some time after in the 2016 as a Pelican site (I have some [article in Italian about Pelican](/series/pelican-for-my-site/)) and some time after Hugo.

I try multiple configuration, I wrote some Pelican plugins and some Hugo stuff but a lot of them are trash...

## Today

The code for this website is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/fundor333/fundor333.github.io) and created using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Automated deployments are done with Github Action and hosted by GitHub Pages.
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is used as the static site generator and the theme is an edited version (by me) of [Hugo Blog Awesome](https://github.com/hugo-sid/hugo-blog-awesome). Some of the icons are from [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

Some part (some of the static pages) of this site are generated from api, some mine, some from external service and some from json files generated by some of mine [Github automation](https://fundor333.com/post/2025/github-action-for-syndication-links/).

The comments are done with [webmentions](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) and hosted with the [Github automation](https://fundor333.com/post/2025/github-action-for-syndication-links/) in the [repo](https://github.com/fundor333/fundor333.github.io) with all other file needed to build the site.
