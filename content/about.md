## Fundor 333's personal space on the web

Pythonista, Backend Developer, Photographer, Dev Ops, Ex-Scout, Bookworm and Tea Lover. Sometime you can find me in a GDG, a DataBeers, a Pycon, a Comicon or other similar event. Huge Open Source fan and user I am allways searching something new to do or to study. Huge fan of automation, autodeploy, data sharing and bots. A lot of my personal stuff are here in my blog and some in my Github.
