- Updating the site with some new static pages and update the content of the old ones. I also wrote a blog post about the statics pages I edited and how much they can be usefull.
- Some cleaning and updating of my django server Appletune. Some migrations are necessary in the near future
- Studing some api for some automation for my django server (Appletune) where I can read the fav article on Feedbin and backup them on my server.
- I find a js project i like: Postlight Parser. I "lost" some time trying it and thing about how to use it
