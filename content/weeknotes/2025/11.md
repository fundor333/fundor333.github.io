And I start doing the Weekly Note.
This week I did more study than other things:

- Start editing the photo of BiComics. A lot of them are similar so I don't need to have a lot of work but they are more than 800 photo to select and edit
- I am cleaning my RSS feed because I have too much post I don't read in my inbox and I want to make a clean Blogroll for my blog
- Some reading about Flatpak and the development of app for Linux (no for now I don't have an app to deploy but maybe...)
- LOVING Monster Hunter Wild (videogame) and love how it work
- Reading material for the next post of my newsletter. This time is about tecnology and dystopia (I follow the news and I feel too much in a distopia)
- Build a little [tool for generate WeekNote](https://pypi.org/project/WeeknoteBot/) like this from feeds and links
