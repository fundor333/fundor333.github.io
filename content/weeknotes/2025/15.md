- I clean my personal feed reader and update the blogroll of my blog. I need more time for cleaning ALL my personal feed reader but making some cleaning every day my feed reader will be without dead ones
- Add a Series page in my blog where I list all the posts interconnected. I will make a post about it and pot some Series into the photos posts, for sorting and collect them.
