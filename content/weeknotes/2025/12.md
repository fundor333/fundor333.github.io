Strange slow week

- Starting an example of a desktop app make in Rust-GTK for making a to-do list. I don't know if I develop my idea/app in Python or Rust.
- Adding some code into my personal server for automation with feeds and rss. It is a personal implementation but it can be part of the desktop app/idea
- Read a lot of blog about deploy an app with Brew, Flatpack and others tools
- Searching for more data to put into this type of blogpost
