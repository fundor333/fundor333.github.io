## Photography

With my Canon camera I am going to some ComicCon near my place and taking a lot of photo of cosplayers. Some of them are share in my [Cosplays' Instagram Account](https://www.instagram.com/fundor333/).

I have also a FujiFilm Camera and I make some Urban Photography and post [here in this site](/photos) and some of them I share in my [Personal Instagram Account](https://www.instagram.com/matteo.scarpa3/).

I also made some edit but nothing I wish to share.

## Dev stuff

I love Django, LaTeX and making bot or automation for my personal stuff so I am allways studing and trying new stuff.
In particular I am trying Django Waytail for my personal curiosity and I am implement Webmention and other Indieweb stuff for my blogs.

## Stationary

I work a lot with stationary like fountain pens, travelers notebook and bulletjournal tecnique so I have some expirience and knowledge with ink, paper and fountain pen. I also use a lot of post-it and other little piece of paper for store information and store in my notebook. And I have an archive of my old notebook and similar stuff.

I also work with ink stamp and wax seal in my personal life with firends, whom also love them.

## Tea

I also love tea and I make sperimentation with it as drink, as ingridient for food, as dessert. I also have a lot of cup and teapot for making tea in some different ways.
