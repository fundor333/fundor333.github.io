I’ve decided to start sharing some episodes that happened to me as an IT technician.

It all began with a request from a very dear friend of mine to take a look at some computers at a stationery store near my house.

This stationery shop had an internet point that had become a haven for all things evil—hell itself—and every virus AVG could possibly detect… Not to mention the spider web/Gordian knot/death trap that was their cable system. That’s where I started, by getting my hands on that setup (I’m not calling it a horror only because, after reading Lovecraft, I know it could have been worse—even if it came close…) and offering on-call tech support.

From this experience came the stories in the series [What Did You Just Do, Sorry?](/series/horror-stories/) (now called Horror stories), an irregularly scheduled column depending on what happens to me.

Personally, I hope it doesn’t happen often—but I know from experience that [Murphy](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legge_di_Murphy) is always lurking, in pleasant company with the [FuckUp Fairy](http://www.soft-land.org/storie/fsckup).
