[^original]: [Why Have a Personal Site Instead of Social Media?](https://kevquirk.com/blog/why-have-a-personal-site-instead-of-social-media) the original post which is a response to the mastodon twoot

[^response]: [Why a personal site rather than social media presence?](https://hamatti.org/posts/why-personal-site-rather-than-social-media-presence/) a response of the original post

The strange thing is I was thinking about it when working on my [Instagram](https://instagram.com/fundor333) because some change on Instagram I now have less visibility.

So this is my point of view.

## The problem with the Social Media

This is the era of Fast Social Media, your social media experience change every year. TikTok, YouTube Short and Instagram Reals are now the new standard, a short type of format which is eating away the other type of post (text, photo, long video) and for now they are the standard.

But now with the AI generating content there will be a change of the type of the post you need to make for the _algorithm god_.

So the main problem of the Social Media is:

1. You don't have control of the social media so you don't have control of what is good or not for the _algorithm god_
2. One day this is a good post[^post] and now it isn't
3. If you make some custom work with the gui of the app/site it will work unless the social media change the gui.

[^post]: Good post is a post which the _algorithm god_ share with a lot of people
