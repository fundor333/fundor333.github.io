## What are happening with the IoT

Now, more than ever, we have all the things connected to the Internet. We have fridges, mirrors, ovens, etc...
And having more and more things connected to the Internet also mean we have more and more things to be target for the hackers.

And we have more and more code (crappy and sicure) in ours house but lot's of people don't know what mean all this code.  So I find three example of problems with the IoT on Twitter and explain them and why they are a vulnerability.

## Now we have problems with our Mirrors?

## Also Facebook has problems with the IoT

## Even the Sex Toy are a target

### And now we have a standard for the security for the sex toy
