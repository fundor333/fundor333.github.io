I need to have a massive **put** in my rest endpoint and Django Rest Framework doesn't do it. So I make my personal method for mycase.

## Setup fo the project

You need to follow the tutorial from the official documentation of [**Django Rest Framework**](https://www.django-rest-framework.org).

After this you have a _MyModel_, MyModelSerializer and a view class MyModelListPost.

## Why I can't use the default?

After you did the tutorial you have a base for a **standard** Django Rest Framework. This mean that you have only a get massive not an update massive. So we make one from scratch.

## The **CODE**

This is the code for **massive put**. You need to map your classes and your fields for make this code working

{{< highlight python >}}

# Code from <https://fundor333.com>

from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework.views i_port APIView
from rest.models import MyModel_
from rest_framework import generics
from rest.serializer import MyModelSerializer

class MyModelListPost(generics.GenericAPIView, APIView):
    queryset = MyModel.objects.all()
    serializer_class = MyModelSerializer

    def put(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        output = []
        for data in request.data:
            try:
                instance = MyModel.objects.get(unique_id=data["unique_id"])
                created = False
            except Exception:
                instance = MyModel.objects.create(
                    field1=data["field1"],
                    field2=data["field2"],
                )
                created = True

            if created:
                serializer = self.get_serializer(data=data)
            else:
                serializer = self.get_serializer(instance, data=data)
            if serializer.is_valid():
                serializer.save()
                output.append(serializer.data)
            else:
                output.append(serializer._errors)
        return Response(output, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)

{{< / highlight >}}

In this case we use the **unique_id** to find any instance and update one by one with the **get** method.
I know it's not very Python Way but if you have some better solution please write below. Thanks
