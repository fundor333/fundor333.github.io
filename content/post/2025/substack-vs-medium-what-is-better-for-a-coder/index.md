I am first and most a Developer and a Coder and I think that coding and developing software (site, app, AI, etc...) need to be a share experience.
So I think a dev must share knowledge in the web. Somebody help people on StackOverflow and someone (like me) blogs.

In the last _X_ years[^1] I understand the important of blogging and why a dev or a coder need to write a blog/newsletter/magazine about what is doing[^2] and how big time sink is developing and maintaining a custom blog so I have this question:

[^1]: Where _X_ is a big but not too big number
[^2]: This is also explained in one of my [old post](https://fundor333.com/post/2020/good-developer-must-be-blogger/)

> For sharing Dev/Coding experiences is better Medium or StackOverflow?[^3]

[^3]: This is my blog/webspace so I say _my opinion_ (coder for more than 5 year)

## We need a generic Dev

This is _Bob_. _Bob_ is a BackEnd Developer, a Python Developer and he is learning some FrontEnd stuffs. So he wants to write about what he knows, what is learning and his doubts.

### What a Dev need to share in a post

_Bob_ need to share fragments of the code he writes, some screenshot (images) and a lot of texts. The latest are a simple request because it is the minimum requirements for all the blogging platform.

The code part is the "difficult" one.

The best situation is if the code is highlighted something like this

``` python
print("Hello World!")
```

and the platform need to support all the types of the files _Bob_'s code but we only need the highlight for the languages...
If _Bob_ needs to blog about _Cobol_ or _Pascal_[^cobol]

[^cobol] Cobol and Pascal are two of the oldest languages and almost every highlighter in a generic blogging platform don't support them, so you need to use a more professional blogging platform and lost time with the custumizations

### Customing and theming

_Bob_ need to have a solid site/blog with a mobile and a desktop layout (more and more people read blog only with the tablet or the phone) and he need to make no changes or as little as possible for making HIS SITE/BLOG.

He also need a notification system for the followers (newsletters, feed, app with notification, ...) and a SEO integration (analytics, meta, etc...) for becoming someone on the web.

Less edit he must do for posting better the platform is.

### Money

_Bob_ is a developer for money so he doesn't want to spend money so... The all budget is 10â‚¬ (all needed for the domain) so the platform is a good one if it is free but is better if _pay_ _Bob_.

So he needs a free platform[^platform_money] and some way to make money from the posts (advertising, subscriptions, etc...)

[^platform_money]: Some function can be hidden by a paywall but if all the _needed_ function are free, the platform is a good one

## And now the platforms

Now we know what _Bob_ needs and wants, we find some platforms.
