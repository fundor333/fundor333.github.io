Once upon a time Internet was different. No social media, no search engine, no fiber...
So how people find new site? Because the internet users share link into the blogs.

And one of the best way to share other blog without filling a webpage with links was the WebRing.

## WebRing?

For [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring) a Webring is

> A webring (or web ring) is a collection of websites linked together in a circular structure, usually organized around a specific theme, and often educational or social.[1] They were popular in the 1990s and early 2000s, particularly among amateur websites.

Today, with the Search Engin owned by the big tec and the AI being part of the mayor Search Engine we need more than ever list of human web pages to read and less AI generated post.

## For example?

Some example of WebRing? This are some type of WebRing

* _A themed WebRing_ Like a [WebRing about Python](https://djangowebring.com/)
* _An Inspirational WebRing_ Like [one for dev and artist](https://webring.xxiivv.com/)
* _One for Group of People_ Like [one for onl;y personal site](https://webring.recurse.com/)
* _One for a Community_ Like [one about IndieWeb](https://xn--sr8hvo.ws/directory)

If you don't find a WebRing for your "community", you can create a new one with a tutorial ( [A Webring Kit](https://mxb.dev/blog/webring-kit/) ) and a framework for making WebRing ( [GitHub Repo from A Webring Kit](https://github.com/maxboeck/webring) )

Remember, this is a free way to have more traffic inside your site and for build your community
