Following the post from [Ruben](https://rubenerd.com/using-re-in-blog-titles/) I start imitating this idea and expand on it.

The basic idea come from a post by [Brandon's Journal](https://brandons-journal.com/re-im-part-of-the-problem/) where Brandon response to an article and use the __Re:__ prefix, like a email threads in the title of the post...

And I add a microformat following the IndieWeb stuff for the response tags.
So my post which are a "Re:" will have a __u-in-reply-to__ in the class of the links for implementing the IndieWeb, like in this article.
