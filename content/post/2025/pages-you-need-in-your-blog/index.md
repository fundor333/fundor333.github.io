More and more blog I read and more and more I find that a lot of the dev blog and personal blog on the web has a lot of common pages but not the old _About_ or _Contacts_ so I make this list of interesting pages types.

## Blogroll

One of the best page I find on a blog. This is a page where the blogger show a link of site/blog (a html page or a Opml file) of interesting stuff.

I find iteresting because I can have an idea about the blogger interest and I can find new and different source of post.

Mine is [here](/blogroll)

## Connect

Half of the old _About Us_ page. In this page the blog put all the link needed to follow and/or contact the author on the classic way (email,...) and the new social way (mastodon, twitter, etc...)

## Feeds

Inspired by [this post](https://marcus.io/blog/making-rss-more-visible-again-with-slash-feeds) the _feeds_ page is the most functional page for user on a site.
This page has all the feeds' links for the blog and other service the blogger is showing. Sometime some feeds aren't from the blog but from other platform of the blogger.

## Now

The other half of the _About Us_ page. It come from an [idea](https://nownownow.com/about) about having a space (in this case a page on a site) about what are you doing with your life and interest.
In this way you can also use it for showing off your little project or have a space for fundraising your project.

Sometime I search on Google now pages for find new project and others things.

## Uses

The strange page (for me). There is a [uses site](https://uses.tech/) where you can send your _Uses_ link where you share what tech you use every day or for the project. In this way you can check what tech other people use and for what.

In this type of pages I love to check what kind of coding and photo set up they have.

## So?

So I suggest to have some of this pages on your blog if you thing of your blog as a personal blog. It can be usefull for start a conversation online or for having a place to send people for answer about your works and your stuffs.
