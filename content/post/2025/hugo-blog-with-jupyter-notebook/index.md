A long time ago, I wrote a [post]({{< relref "/post/2017/jupyter-notebook-pelican-combo/" >}}) about writing a post for the Pelican static site generator made with a Jupyter Notebook. I did it because, at the time, I was a huge fan of the Notebooks and I had the blog generated by Pelican so...

And now, after a PyDataVe (the 22nd event), I make a Jupyter Notebook after a lot of time and I feel the need to have a solution for make a Jupyter Notebook one of the post of my blog so I find a way to do it. This time in Hugo

## Jupyter in my Hugo

So first I search for a way to convert a Jupyter Notebook to a Markdown file with the headers for Hugo. So I find a [python module](https://github.com/soda92/hugo-nbconvert) to generate a Notebook with a starting metadata for my blog. All the metadata are inside the first cell set as a Markdown type cell.

All this is made by launching this command for generate the notebook

``` bash
hugo_nbnew content/post/test-hugo-page
```

And at the end of all the writing I launch this command

``` bash
hugo_nbconvert content/post/test-hugo-page/index.ipynb
```

for generate/updating the markdown file for Hugo.

## Other little things I have done

After testing all of this stuff I make some script for my personal writing pipeline (if I don't make some automation I feel bad) I fix some CSS of my site for the code part. I am a Backend Dev, so I don't share my CSS edit because it is something working but not so pretty to share...

After that I find myself wanting to have some way to cite a part of the post with a link (because I want to share a specific part of the post as a response to post/tweet/tooth on the web) and I search for something clean and usefull.

So I find a [JS script](https://www.bryanbraun.com/anchorjs/) for adding deep anchor links to my post and I set it to add a deep anchor for every paragraph of the posts.

And after all I check if I implement the [meta tag for journalism for Mastodon](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2024/07/highlighting-journalism-on-mastodon/) because I share a lot of stuff on Mastodon.

## Final consideration

I like my new configuration with the possibility to add Jupyter Notebook in my blog and this is the first Notebook I had to my Hugo Blog. I also like the idea that I can work for something else, make a Notebook and, only changing the data, make multiple article about something with the updated data every time I need to add the blog with the latest report for the dataset.
