Sometime you will need to have a template for the commit message.

Allways put something (ticket code, bug code, etc...), order of stuff, some command for the CI system, etc...

## How to do

In Git you can set a a file as the template for the git commit.
You can do it for a single project or for your user.
In this case I will show the command for all your project.

### The config

First you need to write a file.
Usualy I make a file in the home ***~/.gitmessage*** where I put the message.
For example a file template is:

{{< highlight bash >}}
# Title of the commit, 50 chars

# Body. What and Why, with Task Id/Bug Id, 72 chars
{{< / highlight >}}

Remember, if a row start with # the row is a comment.

After you make your own themplate you must tell git where is it so you need to launch this command:

{{< highlight bash >}}
 git config --global commit.template ~/.gitmessage
{{< / highlight >}}

After this git will use your new template for the commit.

Good work
