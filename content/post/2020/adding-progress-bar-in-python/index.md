Sometime you need to make a script or a program with some task and show to the user you are doing something so you need to write something as output: a Progress Bar.

You have multiple way to do it and now I will show some way to do it with packages.

## Progress

The first package I present is __[progress](https://github.com/verigak/progress)__, an easy python package with a lot of configuration.

![Progress.py gif](progress.gif)

This package is base of one object, the __Bar__, and you set it, you use it for update the progressbass or end it.

### For example

You have this _base_ code:

~~~python
from time import sleep

for i in range(100):
 sleep(1)
 print(i)
~~~

This code print the first 100 number one for row. If I want to use a progress's progress bar I need to to something like this:

~~~ python
from time import sleep
from progress.bar import Bar

bar = Bar('Processing', max=20)
for i in range(100):
 sleep(1)
 print(i)
 bar.next()
bar.finish()
~~~

This is a base version of the code for a _bar_ but you can add a lot of configs like suffix, max value, remaing and other things.[^1]

## Progressbar2

This is a package wich use iterators for working. You can also create custo widgets (or bars) for creating your custom expirences.

### Example

Using the example code

~~~ python
from time import sleep
import progressbar

for i in progressbar.progressbar(range(100)):
 sleep(1)
 print(i)
~~~

you can have a progress bar using an iterator.
If you need to edit the navbar you can make a custom widgets like the next example

~~~ python
from time import sleep
import progressbar

widgets=[
    ' [', progressbar.Timer(), '] ',
    progressbar.Bar(),
    ' (', progressbar.ETA(), ') ',
]

for i in progressbar.progressbar(range(100), widgets=widgets):
 sleep(1)
 print(i)
~~~

This is a custom output for the progress bar following the docs find in the project documentation[^2]

## TQDM

THe fastest one for install and a very easy one.

![Tqdm.py gif](tqdm.gif)

Not huge for the customizing part but a good one. It also skip unnecessary iteration displays.

### Example

Allwayse with our lovely code:

~~~ python
from time import sleep
from tqdm import tqdm

for i in tqdm(range(100)):
 sleep(1)
 print(i)
~~~

Here[^3] for the docs.

## Alive progress

This is the fancy package for progress bar.

![Alive gif](alive-progress.gif)

If you need a fancy progress bar this is the best one.

### Example

With our favorite example this is an example

~~~ python
from time import sleep
from alive_progress import alive_bar

items = range(100)
with alive_bar(len(items)) as bar:
 for i in items:
  sleep(1)
  print(i)
  bar()
~~~

With the correct config[^4] you can have some of the best animation ever.
