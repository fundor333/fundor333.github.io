preview_text_from_reply: I love a short week, let’s also do a short weeknote.We drove
  up to just outside Birmingham on Friday and spent the weekend with Charlotte’s uni
  friends. We had a great time catching up, drinking, and enjoying the hot tub. It
  felt effortless and relaxing.On Sunday we went for a little walk to a nearby brewery,
  then back for mexican food and more hot tub.The Airbnb came with a very friendly
  cat named Kevin and a good amount of weird taxidermy.
