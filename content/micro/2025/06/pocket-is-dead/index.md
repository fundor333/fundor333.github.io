Pocket is dead and in the next few days they will be delete forever. So I wrote my Django app for this (my personal Pocket) but if you are note a coder or you don't want to support this code you can use other software.

I suggest Shiori (https://github.com/go-shiori/shiori) with PikaPods (https://www.pikapods.com/) as hosting.

This is not sponsored by anyone but a real dev who had a problem and fixs it
